# AltSchool-Assignments
This repository is for coding assignments from AltSchool Africa
I'm Mugasa Tuhumwire a Backend Engineering student at AltSchool Africa.
I'm a graduate of Information Systems and Technology from Makerere University in the early 2024.
I work at Pearl of Africa International School as an IT support officer and ICT instructor.
So, I decided to take on the Backend Engineering course with AltSchool Africa so that I can buil on my career skills by gaining the advanced IT skills for better IT opportunities.
I also had the love and passion for IT and particularly in being a software developer and database administrator since my HighSchool age.
